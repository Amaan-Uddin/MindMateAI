TODO :
    - If during signup the thread creation operation fails then delete user and make them re-signup

Findings :
    - The threadId works as a single source of context for each user, meaning that when we invoke a model
      and provide it with messages, the model will create snapshots for that specific threadId or uuid
      meaning we would need to inject the summary on each new instance of a thread/conversation
      so the threadId does not work as we supposed it to, like a id to track messages.
    
    - Plausible Solutions:
        - inject the summary only if there are no messages of the user linking to the thread
